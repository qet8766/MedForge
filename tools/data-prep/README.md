# Data Prep Helpers

Place one-off or repeatable dataset preparation helpers in this directory.

Guidelines:

- Keep source scripts only (`.py`, `.sh`, etc.); never commit generated bytecode.
- Prefer reproducible scripts that can regenerate derived artifacts.
- Keep competition holdout/manifest runtime data under `apps/api/data/competitions/`.
- Keep full mirrored datasets under `datasets/` (or host-configured `MEDFORGE_DATASETS_ROOT`).
