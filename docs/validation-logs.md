## Historical Notes

Historical pre-phase-model artifacts were retired from this repository during terminology cleanup and phase-model consolidation.

## Update Rule

- Update `docs/phase-checking-strategy.md` and this file in the same change set for every accepted phase run.
- Keep this file concise; do not append long raw command transcripts here.
- Store long transcripts as separate immutable files under `docs/evidence/<date>/`.
